## AUTPRIMEAPP
#Brief description of AUTPRIMEAPP

The AUT Prime app is a mobile application dedicated to provide easy access of Auckland University of Technology online services to its students.
Services include student email, courses, grades, campus maps, calendar and even provide a notepad function for the students notes.


***IMPORTANT***
This app is unfortunately, experiencing some merge conflicts and therefore it is not possible to test the app as a whole. We were only able to merge the Login Activity fully, and had some serious troubles merging the others. This is obviously our main priority going into Sprint 2, as you will see later on, it requires some rather specific and un-user friendly steps for it to function.

In order to test the functionality of the app, please follow these instructions.

1. Clone the repo (Master) into Android Studio.
2. You may have to install suitable platforms and/or sync the project once cloned. It should ask you to do so if need be.
3. Checkout from the master to the remote branches connected to this repo.
4. Create a local branch onto your machine.
5. Once these steps have been followed, the code for the branches should be open, and you should be able to run them.

The currently functioning branches are as follows; 
LoginActivity, HomepageActivity, CourseActivity, EmailActivity and MapActivity.
